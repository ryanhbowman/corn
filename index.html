<h1>Fields of Corn</h1>
  <p>
    In southern Illinois, Owen owns a small farm with just enough acreage to seem overwhelming to a lay visitor and be mildly profitable but not enough to give a comfortable living. Owen works it on his own with a small group of loyal farm workers. Owen has two sons, one daughter and a wife. The family is happy, stable and part of a small, close-knit community. The family has been there for multiple generations and are proud of the history of the land. Hazel, the mother, works at Gill's Diner, a meeting point for the community
  </p> 
<p>  
    Vic, the oldest son, takes an interest in farming but, unlike his siblings, also excels in school. He eventually goes to Stanford University and gets a job in Silicon Valley, alienating his brother and sister and going against his father's wishes that he take over the farm. The family and entire small-farm enterprise in the midwest is feeling the effects of climate change and overly ambitious expansion - after steadingly rising for 70 years, yields have taken a nose dive in the in the past decade.
   </p> 
<p> 
    When Vic is 30, by now a comfortable tech scene stalwart with a tiny house in Palo Alto worth $3m, his father dies suddenly in the field with his workers. Paul, Vic's brother, a self-aware, charming semi-alcoholic tries to take over the farm but in the space of a year produces the worst crop in a generation while driving away loyal workers.
   </p> 
<p> 
    Vic, plagued by lingering guilt around his father's death, bored in his California life after a successful exit from a social media company and feeling needed back at home decides to return to take over the farm from his ne'er-do-well brother. David is glad to have the farm off his back and stays to help Vic. The first place Vic goes is Gill's and the waitress knows his usual. We think it’s a love interest but it turns out to be his sister Barbara. He spends a few weeks basking in the idiosyncrasies of his home with Barbara and her friends, thrown into relief by his previous life in Palo Alto. He returns to the popcorn factory where you can get giant trash bags of leftover corn for a dollar, he goes to the playgrounds of his youth to find Indian beads, screws up his Tesla suspension driving over the depression era brick streets, etc.
  </p> 
<p>  
    He also starts going about the business of fixing the farm, applying Silicon Valley smarts where he can. Working with ag start-up friends back in CA, he installs sophisticated ecosystem trackers in all the fields – you don't know what you don't know. He also makes dramatic changes to the farm which historically, like all the farms in the area, grew exclusively soybeans and corn using the same basic processes from 50 years except with slightly more slightly more sophisticated insecticides. He begins growing genetically modified tobacco not for cigarettes but for protein-creation for the cosmetic industry; he covers two of his fields with next-generation indoor farming operations, growing lucrative berry and fresh vegetable crops that he ships to 5 star restaurants in Chicago, he leaves portions of the farm land fallow instead planting a giant wildflower field in honor of his father that doubles as an insect bonanza.
  </p> 
<p>  
    Each day he wanders through the fields like he did when he was a kid. Tired of walking he buys an electric mountain bike for his trips, using it to power through the row after row of corn to check on his crops. The local community sees him as a returned prodigal son but also as a bizarro world farmer. It takes a while but he is successful and happy; his competence wins the day and he finally feels he did his father proud.
  </p> 
  <p>
  On one of his rides, in the middle of a grid square, surrounded by corn he finds a giant tree that he has never seen before. He is surprised, curious and confused. When he returns a few weeks later to show Barbara, to his amazement the single tree has turned into a small grove. He takes samples of the tree bark as well as an ear of corn from the field for analysis. He also downloads the data from his ecosystem tracker. He spends time trying to determine what is happening, enlisting plant science experts from across the Midwest. One of these, a mycelium expert named Olida, tells him about the fungi network that lies underneath the entirety of America and that is sort of the internet of the plant world. He dismisses this theory partly because the distraction of harvest which arrives during his investigation. It transpires the field with the mystery trees has 30% higher yields than its neighbours. Pleased but also confused, Vic redoubles his investigative efforts.
  </p>
<p> 
    Post harvest, Vic rides his bike to the grove to contemplate the mystery. With the corn plants gone and the fields flat, sparse and spreading monotonously into the horizon, he can hear the insect songs have synced in a way he has never heard before. The sound is all encompassing, an aural claustrophobia to replace the physical claustrophobia caused by the now harvested 10 ft tall corn plants. As he rides away he goes by his ecosystem tracker and realises it is making the same sound as the insects and with the same rhythm, like the conductor of an insect orchestra. Vic grabs the entire tracker and takes it to the house. He dismantles it to check what is happening and discovers a partially damaged vibrating chip that makes the insect noise. His start-up CA friends tell him it is an alpha feature they have been experimenting with that uses radio waves to attract a plant-positive insect community. Analysing the chip, he realises the accidental damage has made it much more effective; as he is looking at it in the microscope, several insects appear in his home.
  </p> 
<p>  
    Working with his friends he replicates the functionality of the damaged chip and, using some makeshift housing, installs a version on all of his fields. Yields sky-rocket in the next harvest. Vic feels his old Silicon Valley self rising up in him and questions his role as pure farmer. He hangs out less and less with his sister and her friends. He is obsessed with the device and the good it could bring to the world. He thinks of his father often.
   </p> 
<p> 
    Vic goes into business selling the devices, starting a company called Owen Co named after his father. He begins by giving out devices for free to any farm with less than 100 acres in Illinois. They are met with scepticism at first but the decreasing yields of the previous years and the promise of a savior eventually wins the day. His reputation in the community turns around. He feels accepted. Spurred on by this success Vic uses his Silicon Valley connections, finds partners, and begins a nationwide rollout.
   </p> 
<p> 
    A powerful group of conspiracy theorists called the Common Sense Alliance, formed in the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 as a misguided anti-5G advocacy group and battle tested in the water wars of the 2030s and now with 15 seats in the House starts a massive campaign against Owen Co claiming the new devices will cause birth defects, blindness and sink holes. The leader of the group meets with Vic. She is a smooth talking 40 year old independently wealthy scientist who seems far more reasonable than her organisation. Cassandra-like, she tells Vic that he doesn't understand what he has done and that he should back off.
  </p> 
<p>  
    Just a month after his millionth device is installed, he gets word that his own family farm, which he has kept, is alight. The trees in the original grove are burning from the top down, like shock-headed fire lollipops. This is the first of a sequence of bizarre incidents occurring on land where these devices are installed. In the beginning they are easy to dismiss. As time goes on they build into a steady drumbeat of creepy, unexplainable moments. In Iowa, forests abutting corn fields fail, fall and rot. In Indians, lakes are dry, rivers suddenly stagnant. Buildings collapse in farming towns in South Dakota. But despite these disquieting events the plants continue to grow. Yields rise, farmers are happy.
   </p> 
<p> 
    Vic knows that something is seriously wrong. As the number of freakish incidents multiply, he returns to his home lab in Illinois and tries to figure out what is happening. He destroys the devices in half his fields but the crops still flourish. He burns a field, the plants come back. He is lost and re-engages his expert community of friends who helped him the first time.
   </p> 
<p> 
    Olida, the fungi expert, is one of his calls. When Vic tells her about the strange happenings she immediately understands the problem. The devices aren't doing what we think they are - the insects are a red herring. Instead these devices work by electrically activating an ancient symbiotic mycovirus that has laid dormant in the fungi network we learned about earlier. Olida starts to suspect a compromised mycelium network is more dangerous than we can imagine.
  </p> 
<p>  
    Together they discover a sink hole on the outskirts of Vic's land where the large wildflower field was planted in honor of Vic's father. They analyse the corn coming from the original field. The corn fruit is outwardly normal but further analysis shows that the kernels themselves have almost zero nutrients – as if they have been chemically hollowed out. The mycelium, driven by the mycovirus, is pulling resources from surrounding ecosystems to grow the crops more efficiently. This explains the failing forests. It is then helping itself to the nutrients from those crops and growing even larger and more powerful.
  </p> 
<p>  
    If allowed to flourish this fungal network would take over the entirety of the US agriculture, draining the nutrients from the land that produces 40% of the worlds corn, 20% of the world's wheat. Eventually, the land would become more and more unstable as the fungi disrupts roots, trees, even building foundations (hence the South Dakotan falling houses), forming a sinkhole the size of three states that would destroy America's food economy and lead to shortages across the world.
  </p> 
<p>  
    Meanwhile out in the world the events are getting more ominous. A sinkhole almost a square mile in diameter appears in Iowa. Farmers are reporting that fields without devices but adjacent to fields with them are also reporting large yield gains. We encounter a farmer driving his truck listening to the Cardinal game on AM radio, as he drives by a field with a device, the transmission is disrupted for a few seconds. We start to understand that the virus is using the device to literally broadcast itself out into the world and that there is no way to stop the mycovirus from spreading. It has figured out a way to spread itself across the globe without the help of the device.
 </p> 
<p>   
    Olida and Vic work to destroy the virus. They develop a simple and speedy way to assay the amount of virus in the fungal network for a field. They use the viral load as their success measure.
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Their first thought is brute force, they remove devices from across the local community – the crops continue to grow
      </li>
       <li>
    They burn a field and do extra deep tilling - viral load is the same
    </li>
       <li>
         They do a sort of fracking where they dig deep enough to reach the fungal network and send down fungicide and water. This works but also completely destroys the field so is unsustainable
    </li>
       <li>
         Inspired by an old book of agricultural techniques and advice from local farmers, they pin a flock of goats in a field to eat the plants, then 100 pigs tear up the land. The viral load stays high.
      </li>
      </ul>
    <p>  
  The two of them in desperation call the Common Sense Alliance for help. The original leader appears and helps to inspire the final answer:
      </p>  
  <p>
    Then Olida has the idea of sort of genetic judo move - inserting a mycovirus vaccine into corn seeds. This tricks the virus into growing its own downfall. They plant the new seeds in the original field. The fungal network does its same trick, sucking the new corn plants dry. But this time the virus gets both the nutrients it needs to grow as well as a massive antibody injection that renders the virus dormant again.
</p> 
<p>   
    The new seeds are distributed across the world, the mycovirus dies and the fungal network is preserved. It takes years for the solution to finalise itself. Complete disaster is avoided but the cost is dear. The giant tree grove symbolically dies. The last we see Vic, he is back to working the land with a set of workers, drawing a parallel to his father's final fate.
